While fully-supervised methods demonstrate excellent results, self-supervised ones, which do not use pixel-level ground truth, attract much attention. However, self-supervised approaches pose a significant performance gap. Box-level annotations provide a balanced compromise between labeling effort and result quality for image segmentation but have not been exploited for the video domain. In this work, we propose a box-supervised video object segmentation proposal network, which takes advantage of intrinsic video properties. Our method incorporates object motion in the following way: first, motion is computed using a bidirectional temporal difference and a novel bounding box-guided motion compensation. Second, we introduce a novel motion-aware affinity loss that encourages the network to predict positive pixel pairs if they share similar motion and color. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised benchmark by 16.4% and 6.9% J \u0026 F score and the majority of fully supervised methods on the DAVIS and Youtube-VOS dataset without imposing network architectural specifications. We provide extensive tests and ablations on the datasets, demonstrating the robustness of our method.","tags":[],"title":"Box Supervised Video Segmentation Proposal Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Md Mohaiminul Islam","Tanveer Hannan","Laboni Sarker","Zakaria Ahmed"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1644624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644624000,"objectID":"15d5bcd22477374acadd2652333937e5","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/covid/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/covid/","section":"publication","summary":"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a pandemic infectious disease that has a severe risk of spreading rapidly. The quick identification and isolation of the affected persons is the very first step to fight against this virus. In this regard, chest radiology images have been proven to be an effective screening approach of COVID-19 affected patients. A number of AI based solutions have been developed to make the screening of radiological images faster and more accurate in detecting COVID-19. In this study, we are proposing a deep learning based approach using Densenet-121 to effectively detect COVID-19 patients. We incorporated transfer learning technique to leverage the information regarding radiology image learned by another model (CheXNet) which was trained on a huge Radiology dataset of 112,120 images. We trained and tested our model on COVIDx dataset containing 13,800 chest radiography images across 13,725 patients. To check the robustness of our model, we performed both two-class and three-class classifications and achieved 96.49% and 93.71% accuracy respectively. To further validate the consistency of our performance, we performed patient-wise k-fold cross-validation and achieved an average accuracy of 92.91% for three class task. Moreover, we performed an interpretability analysis using Grad-CAM to highlight the most important image regions in making a prediction. Besides ensuring trustworthiness, this explainability can also provide new insights about the critical factors regarding COVID-19. Finally, we developed a website that takes chest radiology images as input and generates probabilities of the presence of COVID-19 or pneumonia and a heatmap highlighting the probable infected regions. Code and models’ weights are availabe.","tags":[],"title":"COVID-DenseNet: A Deep Learning Architecture to Detect COVID-19 from Chest Radiology Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena A.

Based upon 17 yr of the Cluster/RAPID observations, we have derived machine-learning-based models to predict the proton intensities at energies from 28 to 962 keV in the 3D terrestrial magnetosphere at radial distances between 6 and 22 RE. We used the satellite location and indices for solar, solar wind, and geomagnetic activity as predictors. The results demonstrate that the neural network (multi-layer perceptron regressor) outperforms baseline models based on the k-nearest neighbors and historical binning on average by ∼80% and ∼33%, respectively. The average correlation between the observed and predicted data is about 56%, which is reasonable in light of the complex dynamics of fast-moving energetic protons in the magnetosphere. In addition to a quantitative analysis of the prediction results, we also investigate parameter importance in our model. The most decisive parameters for predicting proton intensities are related to the location—Z geocentric solar ecliptic direction—and the radial distance. Among the activity indices, the solar wind dynamic pressure is the most important. The results have a direct practical application, for instance, for assessing the contamination particle background in the X-ray telescopes for X-ray astronomy orbiting above the radiation belts. To foster reproducible research and to enable the community to build upon our work we publish our complete code, the data, and the weights of trained models.
